Explanation: 
    Operand 7(op7) is at DataBase + 50
    Operand 14(op14) in I/O 30
    Task: Subtract operand 7 from Operand 14 and save the result in memory at DataBase + 60

CodeBase: 350 -> Where the instuctions start
DataBase = 725: Where the operands(data) start

Task:
    1- Get op14 from I/O30
    2- Get op7 from DataBase + 50(Memory address 725+50=775)
    3- op7 - op14 => DataBase + 60 = 785 Memory address 
    Load operand from I/O buffer #30, subtract the operand stored at memory location 775 (DataBase + 50), 
    and store the result at memory location 785 (DataBase + 60).

Code:

; Code starts at CodeBase address 350

        ORG 350       ; Set the starting address to 350

START:  IN  30        ; Instruction 3030:
                      ; "3" indicates an Input operation.
                      ; Reads from I/O device 30 (which holds operand 14)
                      ; and loads it into the accumulator (AC).

        SUB 775       ; Instruction 6775:
                      ; "6" indicates a Subtract operation.
                      ; Subtracts the value stored at memory address 775 (operand 7)
                      ; from the accumulator.
                      ; AC = 14 - 7 = 7

        STO 785       ; Instruction 2785:
                      ; "2" indicates a Store operation.
                      ; Stores the value in the accumulator into memory address 785,
                      ; which is the target storage location.

        HLT           ; Halt execution.
